Subject: Submission of Paper: "Enhancing Efficiency and Performance of Face Recognition Model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)"

Dear Editor,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to submit my paper titled "Enhancing Efficiency and Performance of Face Recognition Model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)" for consideration for publication in International Journal of Latest Transactions in Engineering and Science.

Face recognition confronts challenges in real-world scenarios, stemming from wide variability in face appearances, illumination effects, and intricate backgrounds within captured images. 

Please find attached the manuscript for your review.

Thank you very much for considering my submission. I look forward to hearing from you regarding the outcome of the review process.

Yours sincerely,
